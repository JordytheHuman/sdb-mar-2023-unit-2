Guess My Color
Have the computer pick a random color. You may have seen such code from conditionals lesson.

Create a while loop to have you keep guessing the color until have a match. Use the JS code of prompt to store the user's input.

Things to consider...
Matching the case
Trimming white space
If they type a color that isn't on the list - use alert()
have a condition setup if you type in "exit" the while loop will stop.
